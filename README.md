**RxJS Subject Types - samples**

RxJs - javascript implementation of ReactiveX

ReactiveX - API for asynchronous programming with observable streams (http://reactivex.io) (https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api)

**Stream**
 - a concept
 - values/event emitted over time like a timeline
 - Marble Diagram -> Stream: ---x------x-----x--------x--x---
 - a stream can easily represent asyncronous data arriving from a source. The best examples would be â€“ users
 	 clicking on a button, ajax responses, an interval etc

**Observable**
- facilitates the stream; emits values and responds to them
- add() - You can add child observers
- remove() - Removing child observers that were added
- unsubscribe() - You can close an observer subscription

**Cold Observable**
- is an observable whose producer ( producer <=> subscribe (next()), emits values/events) is activated once a subscription has been created
- a cold observable is an observable with a producer that's created inside of the observable
- Whenever a new subscription is created, it will receive the same values, even the subscription was created at a different time

**Hot Observable**
- the producer emits values outside the observable (<=> producer is either created or activated 	  		outside of subscription)
- a truly hot observable is one that emits values without a subscriber having subscribed to it

**Subject**
 - different type of Observable that has different capabilities
 - is an Observable and Observer simultaneously (<=> observer that can emit values/events)

**BehaviorSubject**
- is a special type of Subject whose only different is that it will emit the last value upon a new observer's 	  subscription
- beside Subject it needs to be initialized with a value

**ReplaySubject**
- it's like the BehaviorSubject except that allows you to specify a buffer or the number of emitted values to     dispatch to observers
- BehaviorSubject only dispatches the last emitted value, and ReplaySubject allows you to dispatch any         		designated number of values
- accepts an optional second argument upon creation, which is referred to as the window time, and it's defined 		in milliseconds. It allows you to define a maximum number of events to return in the first argument, and the 		second argument is the time in milliseconds

**AsyncSubject**
- only emits the very last value, and will only do so once .complete() has been called on the subject
